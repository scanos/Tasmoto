Make sure Light is on at night~
Using Timers, you can set a light to turn on and off to illuminate a street/patio by night. But if the device has no power at the trigger time, then, when it powers up, the light will be off all night. So, as a fail-safe, implement a conditional control to be checked at Tasmota Startup.

Set Timers to turn on your light at Sunset and Turn off at sunrise. Use poweronstate 0 in order to start with lights off when powering up your device. Set the following rules:


Rule1
  ON Time#Initialized DO Backlog event checksunrise=%time%; event checksunset=%time% ENDON
  ON event#checksunset>%sunset% DO Power1 1 ENDON
  ON event#checksunrise<%sunrise% DO Power1 1 ENDON

to turn witty built in led on when say someone within a certain distance
Rule1 on SR04#Distance<50 do backlog dimmer 100;delay 300;dimmer 0 endon 

REMEMBER TO ACTIVATE RULES USE rule1 on

To create rules remotely on another device use the following 
curl -X GET --proto-default http "http://192.168.1.239/cm?user=admin&password=very_strong_password&cmnd=Rule1%20On%20switch3%20state=OFF%20do%20dimmer%20100%20endon"

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
These commands should not be used in production areas unless you strength the security around the configuration. The steps to do this include
1. Use a strong web admin password on the Witty / Tasmota device 
(From the Witty web interface go to the menu Configuration/Configure Other/ then set and enable the Web Admin Password 
To use the web admin password in your scripts you will need to use the format "cm?user=admin&password=very_strong_password&cmnd=" 
Obviously you have to remember the password.

2. Do not use on a LAN which has a sensitive data. Consider partitioning the LAN for your IOT devices and use a DMZ.

3. Enable HTTPS on your Tasmota devices.

4. Ensure your scripts are OWASP compliant

5. etc
